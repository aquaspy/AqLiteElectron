# AQLite and Aquastar's reason to exist

### Update: Following comments are from before Spider got hired into AE.

## Why?

Sadly, I know that it is against the TOS to use third party launchers. As long I like AE and AQW, I think that their game needs some of the quality of life improvements in AqLite
For example, farming Blood gem of the Archfiend in /join evilwarnul and the other maps is very painful if you don't want to accept Archfiend's Favor neither Dage's favor, or any of the lair ones. The drops appear in the whole screen, lags a lot and makes the experience of farming a lot worse.

There is 133Spider's Aqlite launcher, that is also an Electron app, but it lacks in a simple place for us. Its windows only and cant expect miracles from wine, when native is 2 clicks away! Some also love linux, so I decided to create a native launcher for it, using Spider's Aqlite file.

## Is it safe?

Well, I will not steal any account. You can check the code and even build it yourself. (Build Instructions bellow).

While this launcher won't steal your account, I can't guarantee that Artix will not ban you. As I said, it goes against the TOS. But for your information, here are Alina comments on twitter:

An artix dev said that they won't ban anyone using AqLite, but AqLite costs more to Artix, because it loads more information from servers. So, if you are using AqLite, make sure to support them even more!

Note from Star: The new mod recruitment in 2021 became such a mess they are banning plp for saying they use Puffin. If vanilla puffin isn't safe, DO NOT say in chat you use anything other than the official launcher to play, and you are safe.

## Is this the same as AqLite?

We have our own code, but we use the aqlite swf and add some more features. We try and keep updated to the latest aqlite version, but if you like the older versions, just press F1 and check out how to use an older version.

# Credits

99% of the credits are deserved to 133spider. Without his efforts, this would not be possible.
This is his repository: https://github.com/133spider/AQLite

Cant say the same for Adobe tho, they killed flash for good, and we cant update flash to the latest supported version without bugging the program.

## For Artix Entertainment

First, thanks for supporting linux, Artix! This means a lot for me and I will make sure to keep supporting the game as I can. And please continue this with the newer AQW Mobile. As we know you didnt with AQ3D even tho the ENGINE SUPPORTS it (ok, you can stop ranting Star...).

Second, I want to contribute, so if you guys want, you are allowed to use any part of my code in your official launcher if you want to.

Third, if you want this repository to be off, create a issue to delete this repository and I will do so. I don't want to get in the way of artix in any way. On the contrary, I want to help.

So if this project gets in the way of any kind of trouble, please come in and open an issue here at github.

## Important thing to say

Artix don't have any responsibility with you as long you are using third party. Also, any bug in our launcher should be reported HERE IN GITHUB, never in artix.
If you think its a Vanilla bug, try it out in the artix's game launcher before reporting to the wrong person.
